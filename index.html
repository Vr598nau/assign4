        <h2>Message from the Guest Editors:</h2>
        <p>Electrocatalytic and electrosynthetic materials play a crucial role in accelerating and controlling electrochemical reactions, which are essential for various applications in energy conversion, environmental remediation, and chemical synthesis. These materials possess unique properties that enable them to efficiently catalyze and facilitate electron transfer during electrochemical processes. Their design and optimization hold significant potential for advancing clean energy technologies, sustainable chemistry, and environmental remediation. Continued research and development in these areas are critical for realizing a more sustainable and low-carbon future.</p>
        <p>This Special Issue is proposed in order to provide and share recent research and developments on novel electrocatalytic and electrosynthetic materials for the high-value conversion of small molecules, as well as on their synthesis, characterization, properties, and simulations. The contributions in this Special Issue will be of great interest to researchers working in the field of electrocatalytic and electrosynthetic materials. Therefore, we welcome research works from scientists, engineers, and industries in these fields.</p>

    <h2>Addendum:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Header:</strong> The header section of the page is designed to create a strong visual impact. It features a dark background color (#333) that adds contrast and draws the viewer's attention. To ensure text readability, the text color is set to white. Additionally, there is 10 pixels of padding around the content to create space, and text alignment is centered for a neat presentation. The main heading within the header uses a large 24px font size to emphasize its importance and uses the Arial font family for a clean and professional appearance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Subheadings (h2):</strong> Subheadings in the page are highlighted with a distinctive blue color (#007bff), which serves to emphasize and differentiate these sections from the rest of the content. The font size for h2 elements is set to 20px, making them noticeably larger and more prominent. The choice of the 'Helvetica Neue' font family adds a modern and stylish touch to the typography. A 20-pixel top margin has been added to separate the subheadings from the preceding content and further distinguish them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Paragraphs (p):</strong> Paragraph text is formatted with a 16px font size to ensure readability. The choice of the Georgia font family lends a classic and elegant appearance to the text. A 10-pixel margin surrounds each paragraph, creating spacing and enhancing the overall structure of the page. Additionally, 5 pixels of padding have been added to each paragraph, which provides a subtle buffer between the text and the surrounding elements, further improving readability and aesthetics.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Links (a):</strong> Links have been styled with a blue color (#007bff) to make them stand out as clickable elements. This visually guides users to recognize and interact with links. To enhance the user experience, the default underline on links has been removed using the "text-decoration: none" property. This approach provides a cleaner, more modern appearance and ensures that links are easily distinguishable from regular text.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Contact Section:</strong> The final section of the page serves as a contact section. It features a light gray background color (#f5f5f5) to distinguish it from the rest of the content and draw the viewer's attention. Extra padding (15px) has been applied to this section to provide additional spacing, ensuring that it stands out visually. This separation helps guide the reader's attention to this important section, making it more accessible and user-friendly.</p>
